                    <p class="blog-text">The hours-long land travel to Baguio via bus is what makes your solo trip
                        adventurous and much more exciting. This will allow you to do sightseeing and savor the view
                        along the way. Baguio is like a friendly city that’s always warm and welcoming, despite the cold
                        weather. People travel to Baguio for a cooler weather, especially during summer. More than that,
                        the City of Pines also has a rich cultural heritage that can be seen in Baguio tourist spots
                        like museums of local artists, arts and craft shops as well as artsy restaurants found in the
                        area.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text"></p>
                    <p class="blog-text">When it comes to quick solo travel near Manila, La Union is the go-to place for
                        friends coming from the city, but that doesn’t mean that you can't travel here solo. </p>
                    <p class="blog-text"> One of the top reasons why it’s best to go here is its accessibility to/from
                        Manila. In just a
                        few hours, you can already reach the town proper of San Juan, La Union. Known for its laidback
                        and relaxing surf beach vibe, La Union is a perfect
                        quick escape if you
                        want to destress and recharge without booking a flight. When traveling solo, it’s good to try
                        things you’ve never done before and push
                        yourself to the
                        limit. So, if you haven’t tried surfing and have been wanting to ride the waves, La Union is a
                        good place to start. It has one of the most beginner-friendly spots to learn.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Apart from surfing, there are some other unique activities you can do here like hiking the
                        Tangadan Falls, cliff jumping, beach bumming and going on a food trip around town. At night, you
                        can choose to grab a bottle or two at Tipple and Brew or mingle
                        with fellow
                        travelers and dance the night away at Flotsam and Jetsam.</p>

                        main reason for your visit.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">Would it be to go on an adventure? To discover the history of the place and

                        deserve.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">There are a lot of Coron tourist spots and activities in store for every type
                        of traveler. But
                        the main attractions are Coron island-hopping tours that will take you to pristine beaches,
                        jaw-dropping lagoons and gorgeous islands like Kayangan Lake.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text"> It may not be a party island like the more popular Boracay, but it houses some
                        good hang out
                        places where you can socialize and meet new people from all over the world. Watching the sunset
                        over a bottle of beer and chatting with newfound friends do sound like a good idea.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text"> If you’re traveling solo for the first time, it’s recommended that you choose
                        a place where it’s
                        safe and with friendly locals to help you navigate around. Coron fits the bill, plus it has
                        hostels and hotels that are budget-friendly for backpackers and
                        solo travelers. There are also cheap restaurants where you can dine and enjoy the local cuisine

                    <p class="blog-text-1">It’s freeing and exciting to go on a solo adventure and accept the challenge
                        of stepping into the unknown. It brings out your independence and confidence.<br><br>
                        It also makes you become more aware of your surroundings to keep you safe wherever you are. Here
                        are some safety travel tips to keep in mind:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text-Bold-1">Stay connected</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">While you don’t have to be online all the time, it’s still better to update
                        your family and friends about your itineraries and whereabouts. Send them a quick message that
                        you’ve arrived safely in your destination or if there’s any change of plans on your end.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text-Bold-1">Bring emergency money</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">Some tourist spots have limited ATM machines and might not be available at all
                        times. It’s better to bring enough pocket money to make sure that you're covered for the entire
                        trip or cover additional costs that you didn't plan for.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text-Bold-1">Talk to the locals</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">Traveling alone doesn’t mean you have to isolate yourself for the whole
                        duration of the trip. This is even the best time to broaden your knowledge and immerse yourself
                        in the place’s culture. Engaging with the locals for some tips and recommendations is a good way
                        to know where most people hang out and the safest spots for solo travelers like you.</p>
                    <p class="blog-text-Bold-1">Research in advance</p>
                    <p class="blog-text">Apart from the things to do and attractions to see, it would also be good to
                        research current news or events in the place you’re heading to. This will give you an idea of
                        what to expect and how to prepare for any unfortunate events that may arise while you’re there.

                    <p class="blog-text">Getting lost is part of the adventure but it’s still advisable to know the best
                        way to explore the area to save you from wasting time and money.</p>

                        going on the unexplored paths but be extra alert and aware to make sure that you won’t be taken
                        advantage of. Traveling solo will teach you how to be self-reliant as you conquer your fears and
                        enjoy life to the fullest on your own.</p>
